🛠️ Best Git Branching Strategies:
GitFlow: A robust branching model with feature, release, and hotfix branches for large-scale projects.
GitHub Flow: A simpler approach with just a main branch, perfect for continuous integration and deployment.
Trunk-Based Development: Focuses on keeping branches short-lived and frequently merging into the main branch to avoid long-lived branches and complex merges.
